## File organization

Pages are arranged according to the routes <br/>
`src/layouts/MD/...` <br/>

Components are divided into two folders, <br/>
`src/components/MDBase` _base components_ <br/>
`src/components/MDComponents` _more complex components that may use the base components_<br/>

There are also cases where a component is specific to a layout/page
`src/components/layouts/some-section/some-page/components`


## _Note:_

_The library version in the package.json is highly dependent with each other,
Please take extra caution in modifying the version manually._
